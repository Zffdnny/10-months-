    <p> Hello My Snow Mahal, </p>
          <p>  You don't understand how much you actually mean to me and i care about you a lot more than myself! I would do anything for you! I just want to make you smile! You are amazing, gorgeous, pretty hazel brown eyes, funny, great personality and have the world most beautiful smile. When i see you or even get a simple text from you my whole world brightens up it's so amazing how you can say hey and put a smile on my face. I love when you laugh and i just love being with you! I'm so happy with you. I can't believe it's already been 10 months that you and i have been together. You've brought so much happiness into my life and I can't possibly thank you enough. I can't wait to meet you and show you how much i appreciate you and how important you are to me and that no matter what happens you've made an everlasting impression on me and i'm beyond thankful to have met you. </p>
            
     <p>      There is a lot of things to thank you for and i don't even know where to begin but i do wanna thank you for being there for me, being the person i can tell anything to, being my weird best partner and most of all my gorgeous Snow Mahal. When i'm with you i'm happy, when you make me smile it brings the sunshine out in me, when i look at your eyes, it's like something i've never felt before. I want to make you happy, make you smile, make you laugh, make you feel wanted. If i had a penny for every time i thought about you, i would only have one, because you never leave my mind. You're my first thought when i wake up and my last thought when i go to bed. You have made me smile and laugh so many times these past months. You have always been there for me. Thank you for being you. You are so amazing and  i'm so lucky to have you by my side. I treasure you so much. I'm glad you and i met </p>
    <p> 
            18.11.2023 forever and always. I treasure you Snow! Nothing on my end is going to change that fact. I'm yourss. I know you said that you're complicated and there's a lot of less complicated woman out there. It doesn't matter about who's complicated or who's not. I choose you. It's not a difficult decision for me. As soon as i met you, my desting was tied with yours. Some people don't or won't understand, some even won't like it. But i choose you  because my heart chose yours long before our bodies were born. So my Mahal, i'm comforted by the fact that my care for you is eternal. I treasure you and everything that comes with you. I treasure all your amazing aspects and all your terrifying sides. If there were a word to describe the feelings i have for you it would be incredible because it is incredible how much i treasure you, and how much i care about you, how i look at you, how i talk about you, and it is really incredible how much i want you for lifetime! How much i want to hold you and hug youu and not let go for a whilee and just care about you the way no one has, and the way no one will. You are my Mahal forever and everr and you are my everything! 
    </p>

    <p> HAPPY 10TH MONTHSARY SNOW MAHAL!</p>
